After running the simulation across various scenarios, 
it's recommended that the new warehouse should be equipped with 20 docks. 
This number optimizes the balance between operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 
With fewer docks, the warehouse experiences significant delays and unloading inefficiencies, 
while more docks do not proportionally increase throughput and add unnecessary operational expenses. 
This recommendation ensures a high rate of truck processing with minimal idle time, maximizing overall revenue generation while keeping operational costs in check. 
This was calculated with an increment of 10 across the board.
